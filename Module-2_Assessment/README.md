## Who's That Pokemon Word Guessing Game

Word guessing game is where you guess a letter and try to match the word. I am using pokemon as a theme.

## Instructions

- Keypress are only valid with alphabetical letter such as (a-z or A-Z).
- If the correct character is pressed, it will reveal in the current word.
- If the wrong character is pressed, it will add to the letter guessed.
- Winning or losing will reveal the correct image and the correct word.
- The game will reset in 2.5 seconds when the game is either winning or losing.
